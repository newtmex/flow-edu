    question: "What is FlowEDU?",
    answer:
      "FlowEDU is a seamless token bridge for the EDU ecosystem. It automates the token bridging process, so you only need to interact with our UI once.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I start bridging?",
    answer:
      "Simply connect your wallet and bind it. Once bound, FlowEDU generates a wallet address for you — just send your tokens there and we’ll handle the rest.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a fee for bridging?",
    answer: "Yes. We charge a small 0.3% fee on each bridged transaction to keep things running smoothly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which chains are supported?",
    answer: "Currently, we support bridging between BNB Chain and EDU Chain. More chains will be added soon.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I control the destination wallet?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The destination is deterministically derived from your bound wallet, and only you can control it through your original wallet signature.",
  },
